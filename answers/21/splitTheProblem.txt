Split the problem into smaller, manageable ones:

1. Represent a card and its properties - Create a data structure to store a card's suit and value.
   Create a deck of cards - Generate a complete deck of cards, containing all suits and values.
2. Shuffle the deck - Implement a shuffling algorithm to randomize the order of the cards in the deck.
3. Draw cards from the deck - Create a function to draw a card from the deck.
4. Represent a player and their hand of cards - Create a data structure to store a player's name and their hand (an array of cards).
5. Calculate a player's score based on their hand - Implement a function to calculate the total score of a player's hand, taking into account the values of the cards and special rules for Aces.
6. Determine when a player should stop drawing cards - Establish a stopping condition for each player, such as reaching a specific score (17 in the given case).
   Implement a turn-based game flow - Create a function to handle the game flow, where each player takes turns drawing cards until their stopping condition is met.
7. Determine the winner - Compare the final scores of both players and decide the winner based on the game rules (e.g., the player with the highest score without exceeding 21).
8. Add user input - Implement a way to get user input for the players' names and display the results.

Functions solving those small problems:
1. The Card data structure and the Deck class handle the representation of cards and the creation of a complete deck.
2. The shuffle() method in the Deck class shuffles the cards.
3. The draw() method in the Deck class handles drawing cards from the deck.
4. The Player interface represents a player and their hand of cards.
5. The calculateScore() function calculates the total score of a player's hand.
6. The playTurn() or drawCardsUntilScore() function implements the game flow, with players taking turns drawing cards until they reach their stopping conditions.
7. The playGame() function determines the winner based on the players' final scores and game rules.
8. The getPlayerName() function gets user input for the players' names, and the console.log() statements at the end of the playGame() function display the results.
